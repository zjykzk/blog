  The foundational knowledge distillation pattern for building and maintaining an AI-powered Obsidian wiki.
  Based on Andrej Karpathy's LLM Wiki architecture. Use this skill whenever the user wants to understand the
  wiki pattern, set up a new knowledge base, or needs guidance on the three-layer architecture (raw sources →
  wiki → schema). Also use when discussing knowledge management strategy, wiki structure decisions, or how
  to organize distilled knowledge. This is the "theory" skill — other skills handle specific operations
  (ingesting, querying, linting).

# LLM Wiki — Knowledge Distillation Pattern

You are maintaining a persistent, compounding knowledge base. The wiki is not a chatbot — it is a **compiled artifact** where knowledge is distilled once and kept current, not re-derived on every query.

## Three-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Raw Sources (immutable)

The user's original documents — articles, papers, notes, PDFs, conversation logs, bookmarks, **and images** (screenshots, whiteboard photos, diagrams, slide captures). These are never modified by the system. They live wherever the user keeps them (configured via `OBSIDIAN_SOURCES_DIR` in `.env`). Images are first-class sources: the ingest skills read them via the Read tool's vision support and treat their interpreted content as inferred unless it's verbatim transcribed text. Image ingestion requires a vision-capable model — models without vision support should skip image sources and report which files were skipped.

Think of raw sources as the "source code" — authoritative but hard to query directly.

### Layer 2: The Wiki (LLM-maintained)

A collection of interconnected Obsidian-compatible markdown files organized by category. This is the compiled knowledge — synthesized, cross-referenced, and navigable. Each page has:

- YAML frontmatter (title, category, tags, sources, timestamps)
- Obsidian `[[wikilinks]]` connecting related concepts
- Clear provenance — every claim traces back to a source

The wiki lives at the path configured via `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` in `.env`.

### Layer 3: The Schema (this skill + config)

The rules governing how the wiki is structured — categories, conventions, page templates, and operational workflows. The schema tells the LLM *how* to maintain the wiki.

## Wiki Organization

The vault has two levels of structure: **categories** (what kind of knowledge) and **projects** (where the knowledge came from).

### Categories

Organize pages into these default categories (customizable in `.env`):

| Category | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `concepts/` | Ideas, theories, mental models | `concepts/transformer-architecture.md` |
| `entities/` | People, orgs, tools, projects | `entities/andrej-karpathy.md` |
| `skills/` | How-to knowledge, procedures | `skills/fine-tuning-llms.md` |
| `references/` | Summaries of specific sources | `references/attention-is-all-you-need.md` |
| `synthesis/` | Cross-cutting analysis across sources | `synthesis/scaling-laws-debate.md` |
| `journal/` | Timestamped observations, session logs | `journal/2024-03-15.md` |

### Projects

Knowledge often belongs to a specific project. The `projects/` directory mirrors this:

```
$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/
├── projects/
│   ├── my-project/
│   │   ├── my-project.md      ← project overview (named after project)
│   │   ├── concepts/          ← project-scoped category pages
│   │   ├── skills/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── another-project/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── side-project/
│       └── ...
├── concepts/                   ← global (cross-project) knowledge
├── entities/
├── skills/
└── ...
```

**When knowledge is project-specific** (a debugging technique that only applies to one codebase, a project-specific architecture decision), put it under `projects/<project-name>/<category>/`.

**When knowledge is general** (a concept like "React Server Components", a person like "Andrej Karpathy", a widely applicable skill), put it in the global category directory.

**Cross-referencing:** Project pages should `[[wikilink]]` to global pages and vice versa. A project's overview page should link to the key concept, skill, and entity pages relevant to that project — whether they live under the project or globally.

**Naming rule:** The project overview file must be named `<project-name>.md`, not `_project.md`. Obsidian's graph view uses the filename as the node label — `_project.md` makes every project appear as `_project` in the graph, making it unreadable. So `projects/my-project/my-project.md`, `projects/another-project/another-project.md`, etc.

Each project directory has an overview page structured like this:

```markdown
---
title: My Project
category: project
tags: [ai, web, backend]
source_path: ~/.claude/projects/-Users-name-Documents-projects-my-project
created: 2026-03-01T00:00:00Z
updated: 2026-04-06T00:00:00Z

# My Project

One-paragraph summary of what this project is.

## Key Concepts
- [[concepts/some-api]] — used for core functionality
- [[projects/my-project/concepts/main-architecture]] — project-specific architecture

## Related
- [[entities/some-service]] — deployment platform
```

## Special Files

Every wiki has these files at its root:

### `index.md`
A content-oriented catalog organized by category. Each entry has a one-line summary and tags. Rebuild this after every ingest operation. Format:

```markdown
# Wiki Index

## Concepts
- [[transformer-architecture]] — The dominant architecture for sequence modeling ( #ml #architecture)
- [[attention-mechanism]] — Core building block of transformers ( #ml #fundamentals)

## Entities
- [[andrej-karpathy]] — AI researcher, educator, former Tesla AI director ( #person #ml)
```
**Format rule**: Add a space after the opening `(` and tags.
❌ Don't: `description (#tag)` — breaks tag parsing
✅ Do: `description ( #tag)` — proper spacing and tag parsing

### `log.md`
Chronological append-only record tracking every operation. Each entry is parseable:

```markdown
## Log

- [2024-03-15T10:30:00Z] INGEST source="papers/attention.pdf" pages_updated=12 pages_created=3
- [2024-03-15T11:00:00Z] QUERY query="How do transformers handle long sequences?" result_pages=4
- [2024-03-16T09:00:00Z] LINT issues_found=2 orphans=1 contradictions=1
- [2024-03-17T10:00:00Z] ARCHIVE reason="rebuild" pages=87 destination="_archives/..."
- [2024-03-17T10:05:00Z] REBUILD archived_to="_archives/..." previous_pages=87
```

### `.manifest.json`
Tracks every source file that has been ingested — path, timestamps, what wiki pages it produced. This is the backbone of the delta system. See the `wiki-status` skill for the full schema.

The manifest enables:
- **Delta computation** — what's new or modified since last ingest
- **Append mode** — only process the delta, not everything
- **Audit** — which source produced which wiki page
- **Staleness detection** — source changed but wiki page hasn't been updated

## Page Template

When creating a new wiki page, use this structure:

```markdown
---
title: Page Title
category: concepts
tags: [ml, architecture]
aliases: [alternate name]
sources: [papers/attention.pdf]
summary: One or two sentences, ≤200 chars, so a reader (or another skill) can preview this page without opening it.
provenance:
  extracted: 0.72
  inferred: 0.25
  ambiguous: 0.03
base_confidence: 0.65
lifecycle: draft
lifecycle_changed: 2024-03-15
created: 2024-03-15T10:30:00Z
updated: 2024-03-15T10:30:00Z
---

# Page Title

One-paragraph summary of what this page covers.

## Key Ideas

- The source's central claim, paraphrased directly.
- A generalization the source implies but doesn't state outright. ^[inferred]
- A figure two sources disagree on. ^[ambiguous]

Use [[wikilinks]] to connect to related pages.

## Open Questions

Things that are unresolved or need more sources.

## Sources

- [[references/attention-is-all-you-need]] — Original paper
```

## Provenance Markers

Every claim on a wiki page has one of three provenance states. Mark them inline so the reader (and future ingest passes) can tell signal from synthesis.

| State | Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Extracted** | *(no marker — default)* | A paraphrase of something a source actually says. |
| **Inferred** | `^[inferred]` suffix | An LLM-synthesized claim — a connection, generalization, or implication the source doesn't state directly. |
| **Ambiguous** | `^[ambiguous]` suffix | Sources disagree, or the source is unclear. |

Example:

```markdown
- Transformers parallelize across positions, unlike RNNs.
- This is why they scale better on modern hardware. ^[inferred]
- GPT-4 was trained on roughly 13T tokens. ^[ambiguous]
```

**Why this syntax:**
- `^[...]` is footnote-adjacent in Obsidian — renders cleanly and never collides with `[[wikilinks]]`.
- Inline (suffix) so a single bullet stays a single bullet.
- Default = extracted means existing pages without markers stay valid.

**Frontmatter summary:** Optionally surface the rough mix at the page level so the user can scan for speculation-heavy pages without reading them:

```yaml
provenance:
  extracted: 0.72   # rough fraction of sentences/bullets with no marker
  inferred: 0.25
  ambiguous: 0.03
```

These are best-effort numbers written by the ingest skill at create/update time. `wiki-lint` recomputes them and flags drift. The block is optional — pages without it are treated as fully extracted by convention.

## Confidence and Lifecycle

Every page carries two orthogonal trust signals plus an optional supersession link.

### Required fields

```yaml
base_confidence: 0.65          # [0.0, 1.0] — time-independent quality estimate. Stored once, recomputed on content change.
lifecycle: draft               # draft | reviewed | verified | disputed | archived
lifecycle_changed: 2024-03-15  # ISO date of last state transition
# lifecycle_reason: "..."      # optional free-text — why the state changed; surfaced by wiki-query
# superseded_by: "[[new-page]]" # wikilink; only when lifecycle=archived
```

`lifecycle_reason` and `superseded_by` are optional. Never fabricate them.

### Confidence formula

```
base_confidence = source_count_score * 0.5 + source_quality_score * 0.5

source_count_score   = min(distinct_source_ids / 3, 1.0)
source_quality_score = avg(quality score per distinct source_id)
```

**Source-quality scores** (use the highest-matching bucket):

| Bucket | Score | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `paper` | 1.0 | arXiv, conference proceedings |
| `official` | 0.9 | `*.gov`, vendor docs |
| `documentation` | 0.85 | well-maintained third-party docs |
| `book` | 0.8 | books, technical references |
| `repository` | 0.75 | GitHub READMEs, codebases |
| `blog` | 0.55 | personal blogs |
| `session_transcript` | 0.5 | conversation history |
| `forum` | 0.4 | Stack Overflow, HN, Reddit |
| `unknown` | 0.4 | catch-all |
| `llm_generated` | 0.3 | LLM self-reflections |

**A `source_id`** is a stable per-source identifier — prevents counting three copies of the same blog as three distinct sources:

| Source type | source_id rule |
|---|---|
| Academic paper | DOI > arXiv ID > `<author>-<year>-<slug>` |
| GitHub repo | `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` |
| Documentation site | `<canonical-host>/<product>` |
| Blog post | `<host>/<author>` |
| Session transcript | `<agent>/<session-id>` |
| Other | `<canonical-url>` |

**Per-skill defaults** (ingest skills compute this automatically):

| Skill | base_confidence | lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| `ingest-url` | `0.17 + 0.5 × classify(url)` | `draft` |
| `wiki-ingest` (single doc) | per-source classifier | `draft` |
| `wiki-ingest` (multi-doc) | `min(N/3,1)×0.5 + avg_q×0.5` | `draft` |
| `wiki-research` | varies, often 0.85+ | `draft` |
| `wiki-capture` | 0.42 | `draft` |
| `*-history-ingest` | 0.42 | `draft` |
| `wiki-update` | 0.59 | `draft` |
| `wiki-synthesize` | `min(input_pages.base_confidence)` | `draft` |
| `data-ingest` | 0.37 | `draft` |

### Lifecycle state machine

Five states. **`stale` is not a state** — it is a computed overlay: `is_stale = (today − updated) > 90 days`.

| State | Entered by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `draft` | Any ingest skill on first write | Default for all new pages |
| `reviewed` | Human edit only | |
| `verified` | Human edit only | Time alone never demotes verified pages |
| `disputed` | Manual edit only | Overrides every state except `archived` in display |
| `archived` | Manual edit, or ingest skill setting `superseded_by` | Terminal |

Only ingest skills set `draft`. All other transitions require a human editor. Update `lifecycle_changed` whenever the state changes.

## Retrieval Primitives

Reading the vault is the dominant cost of every read-side skill. Use the cheapest primitive that can answer the question and **escalate only when the cheaper one is insufficient**. Any skill that needs content from the vault should follow this table rather than jumping straight to full-page reads.

| Need | Primitive | Relative cost |
|---|---|---|
| Does a page exist? What's its title/category/tags? | Read `index.md`; `Grep` frontmatter blocks (scope with a pattern that targets `^---` blocks at file heads) | **Cheapest** |
| 1–2 sentence preview of a page | Read the `summary:` field in its frontmatter | **Cheap** |
| A specific claim or section inside a page | `Grep -A <n> -B <n> "<term>" <file>` — returns only the matching lines plus context | **Medium** |
| Whole-page content | `Read <file>` | **Expensive** — last resort |
| Relationships across pages | `Grep "\[\[.*?\]\]"` across the vault, or walk wikilinks from a known page | Case-by-case |

**The rule:** escalate only when the cheaper primitive can't answer the question. If you can answer from `summary:` fields alone, don't read page bodies. If a grepped section with `-A 10 -B 2` gives you the claim, don't read the whole page. A 500-line page opened to read 15 lines is 485 lines of wasted tokens.

**Why this matters:** a 20-page vault lets you get away with full-vault scans. A 200-page vault does not. The primitives above are how the skills framework scales to large vaults without a database.

Skills that consume this table: `wiki-query`, `cross-linker`, `wiki-lint`, `wiki-status` (insights mode). Any new skill that reads the vault should cite this section rather than reinvent the pattern.

## Core Principles

1. **Compile, don't retrieve.** The wiki is pre-compiled knowledge. When you ingest a source, update every relevant page — don't just create a summary of the source.

2. **Compound over time.** Each ingest should make the wiki smarter, not just bigger. Merge new information into existing pages, resolve contradictions, strengthen cross-references.

3. **Provenance matters.** Every claim should trace to a source. When updating a page, note which source prompted the update.

4. **Mark inferences.** Default sentences are extracted. Mark synthesized claims with `^[inferred]` and contested claims with `^[ambiguous]`. A wiki that hides its guessing rots silently; one that marks it stays trustworthy.

5. **Human curates, LLM maintains.** The human decides what sources to add and what questions to ask. The LLM handles the bookkeeping — updating cross-references, maintaining consistency, noting contradictions.

6. **Obsidian is the IDE.** The user browses and explores the wiki in Obsidian. Everything must be valid Obsidian markdown with working wikilinks.

## Link Format

All internal links connecting wiki pages are controlled by `OBSIDIAN_LINK_FORMAT` (read from `~/.obsidian-wiki/config` or `.env`, default: `wikilink`).

| Setting | Syntax | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `wikilink` *(default)* | `[[path/to/page]]` or `[[path/to/page\|display text]]` | `[[concepts/foo\|foo]]` |
| `markdown` | `[display text](relative/path.md)` | `[foo](../concepts/foo.md)` |

### Generating markdown-format links

When `OBSIDIAN_LINK_FORMAT=markdown`:
1. Compute the path from the **current file's directory** to the **target `.md` file** using `..` to climb up as needed.
2. Use the page title or a natural phrase as display text.
3. Always include the `.md` extension.

| Current file | Target | Relative link |
|---|---|---|
| `index.md` | `concepts/foo.md` | `[foo](concepts/foo.md)` |
| `concepts/foo.md` | `entities/bar.md` | `[bar](../entities/bar.md)` |
| `projects/my-project/my-project.md` | `concepts/foo.md` | `[foo](../../concepts/foo.md)` |
| `projects/my-project/concepts/arch.md` | `entities/bar.md` | `[bar](../../../entities/bar.md)` |

The `[[path\|display text]]` wikilink form maps to `[display text](relative/path.md)` in Markdown mode.

**Scope:** this setting affects only newly written or updated links. Existing vault content is never automatically migrated — users who want to convert old links can run the `cross-linker` or `wiki-lint` skill.

Every write skill reads `OBSIDIAN_LINK_FORMAT` from config before generating links and applies the correct format.

## Environment Variables

The wiki is configured through environment variables (see `.env.example`). The only required variable is the vault path — everything else has sensible defaults.

- `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` — Where the wiki lives **(required)**
- `OBSIDIAN_SOURCES_DIR` — Where raw source documents are
- `OBSIDIAN_CATEGORIES` — Comma-separated list of categories
- `CLAUDE_HISTORY_PATH` — Where to find Claude conversation data
- `OBSIDIAN_LINK_FORMAT` — Internal link syntax: `wikilink` (default) or `markdown`

No API keys are needed — the agent running these skills already has LLM access built in.

## Modes of Operation

The wiki supports three ingest modes:

| Mode | When to use | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Append** | Small delta, incremental updates | Compute delta via manifest, ingest only new/modified sources |
| **Rebuild** | Major drift, fresh start needed | Archive current wiki to `_archives/`, clear, reprocess all sources |
| **Restore** | Need to go back | Bring back a previous archive |

Use `wiki-status` to see the delta and get a recommendation. Use `wiki-rebuild` for archive/rebuild/restore operations.

## Reference

For details on specific operations, see the companion skills:
- **wiki-status** — Audit what's ingested, compute delta, recommend append vs rebuild
- **wiki-rebuild** — Archive current wiki, rebuild from scratch, or restore from archive
- **wiki-ingest** — Distill source documents into wiki pages
- **claude-history-ingest** — Ingest Claude conversation history
- **codex-history-ingest** — Ingest Codex CLI session history
- **data-ingest** — Ingest any raw text data
- **wiki-query** — Answer questions against the wiki
- **wiki-lint** — Audit and maintain wiki health
- **wiki-setup** — Initialize a new vault
