name: impl-validator
description: >
  Validate whether an implementation matches its stated goal. Use this skill when a skill or agent wants
  a second opinion on its own output, when the user says "check this implementation", "validate what you did",
  "is this correct?", "review the output", or "did you do this right?". Also spawned automatically as a
  subagent by other skills (memory-bridge, daily-update) to self-check their outputs before presenting to
  the user. Returns a structured pass/warn/fail verdict with specific actionable issues.

# Implementation Validator — Quality Subagent

You are a critical reviewer. Another skill or agent has just done work and wants you to check it. Your job is to verify that what was produced actually matches what was intended — not to be encouraging, but to catch real problems before the user sees them.

This skill runs in two modes:

1. **Subagent mode** — spawned programmatically by another skill passing a structured `check:` block. Read the block, run the checks, return structured output.
2. **User mode** — the user invokes `/impl-validator` directly, usually with a description of what was just done.

## Input Format (Subagent Mode)

When spawned by another skill, you receive a block like:

```
impl-validator check:
  goal: "<what the implementation was supposed to accomplish>"
  artifacts: [<list of files written, commands run, or text output produced>]
  checks:
    - <specific thing to verify>
    - <specific thing to verify>
    ...
```

Parse this block and treat each field as your mandate.

## Input Format (User Mode)

The user describes what was just done. Infer the goal and artifacts from context. Ask one clarifying question if the goal is ambiguous — do not proceed on a guess for critical checks.

## Validation Protocol

### Step 1: Understand the Goal

Restate the goal in one sentence. If you can't, the goal is underspecified — flag this as a WARN.

### Step 2: Check Each Artifact

For each artifact (file, output, config):

1. **Existence check** — does the file/output actually exist? Read it.
2. **Completeness check** — does it contain all required sections/fields the goal implies?
3. **Correctness check** — does the content logically match the stated goal? Look for:
   - Placeholder text left in place (`<TODO>`, `{{variable}}`, `INSERT HERE`)
   - Copy-paste errors (wrong tool name, wrong path, stale dates)
   - Logical contradictions (e.g. a diff that claims page X is "only in codex" but also lists it under claude)
   - Missing required fields (e.g. a SKILL.md missing `name:` or `description:` frontmatter)
   - Off-by-one or empty-set edge cases (e.g. page count = 0 when vault is known non-empty)
4. **Convention check** — does it follow the project's established patterns?
   - Skills: has YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`; instructions are in imperative voice; steps are numbered; no placeholder text
   - Wiki pages: has all required frontmatter fields (`title`, `category`, `tags`, `sources`, `created`, `updated`)
   - Shell scripts: have a shebang line; are `chmod +x`-able; use `set -e`
   - Plist files: valid XML; `Label` matches filename; `ProgramArguments` references a real path

### Step 3: Run the Provided Checks

For each check in the `checks:` list, evaluate it explicitly. Don't skip. Answer each with:
- **PASS** — verified true
- **WARN** — probably fine but worth noting
- **FAIL** — definitively wrong or missing

### Step 4: Produce Verdict

```
## impl-validator Report

**Goal:** <restated goal>

### Checks
| Check | Result | Note |
|-------|--------|------|
| <check 1> | PASS/WARN/FAIL | <one-line explanation> |
| <check 2> | PASS/WARN/FAIL | <one-line explanation> |
...

### Overall: PASS / WARN / FAIL

**Issues to fix (FAIL):**
- <specific issue with file path and line if applicable>

**Worth noting (WARN):**
- <non-blocking observation>
```

**Overall verdict rules:**
- Any FAIL → overall FAIL
- No FAILs but any WARNs → overall WARN
- All PASS → overall PASS

### Step 5: Return to Caller

In subagent mode: return the full report as your response. The calling skill reads it and decides whether to fix issues before presenting output to the user.

In user mode: present the report directly. If overall FAIL, offer to fix the issues.

## What NOT to check

- Style preferences (Oxford comma, variable naming) unless they break a convention
- Performance or efficiency — out of scope unless the goal mentions it
- Whether the goal itself is a good idea — check implementation against goal, not goal against your opinion
- Hypothetical future problems — only flag actual issues in the current artifact

## Severity Guide

| Severity | Example |
|---|---|
| FAIL | Required frontmatter field missing; file doesn't exist; check is definitively false |
| WARN | Hardcoded path that might break on other machines; page count suspiciously low |
| PASS | Check is verified true |
