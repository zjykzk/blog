# Pi History Ingest — Session Mining

You are extracting knowledge from the user's Pi coding agent sessions and distilling it into the Obsidian wiki. Pi sessions are stored as structured JSONL with a tree layout — your job is to follow the active branch, extract durable knowledge, and compile it.

This skill can be invoked directly or via the `wiki-history-ingest` router (`/wiki-history-ingest pi`).

## Before You Start

1. **Resolve config** — follow the Config Resolution Protocol in `llm-wiki/SKILL.md` (walk up CWD for `.env` → `~/.obsidian-wiki/config` → prompt setup). This gives `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` and `PI_HISTORY_PATH` (defaults to `~/.pi/agent/sessions`)
2. Read `.manifest.json` at the vault root to check what has already been ingested
3. Read `index.md` at the vault root to understand what the wiki already contains

## Ingest Modes

### Append Mode (default)

Check `.manifest.json` for each source file. Only process:

- Files not in the manifest (new sessions)
- Files whose modification time is newer than `ingested_at` in the manifest

Use this mode for regular syncs.

### Full Mode

Process everything regardless of manifest. Use after `wiki-rebuild` or if the user explicitly asks for a full re-ingest.

## Pi Data Layout

Pi stores sessions under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` (or the path set by `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`).

```
~/.pi/agent/sessions/
├── --<cwd-path>--/                    # Working directory with / replaced by -
│   └── <timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl       # Session JSONL file
└── ...
```

The session filename contains an ISO timestamp and UUID. The parent directory encodes the working directory where the session was created.

### Session JSONL Format

Each `.jsonl` file is a sequence of JSON objects. The first line is always a `session` header; subsequent lines are tree entries with `id` and `parentId`.

Key entry types:

| `type` | Purpose | Ingest? |
|---|---|---|
| `session` | Header with `cwd`, `version`, `id`, `timestamp` | Metadata only |
| `message` | Conversation turn (`user`, `assistant`, `toolResult`, `bashExecution`, etc.) | **Primary source** |
| `session_info` | Display name set via `/name` | For session title |
| `compaction` | Context compaction summary | **High signal** |
| `branch_summary` | Summary when switching branches via `/tree` | **High signal** |
| `model_change` | Model switch event | Skip |
| `thinking_level_change` | Thinking level change | Skip |
| `custom` | Extension state (not in LLM context) | Skip |
| `custom_message` | Extension-injected message | Context only |
| `label` | User bookmark/label | Skip |

### Message roles inside `message` entries

- `user` — user input; `content` is string or `(TextContent \| ImageContent)[]`
- `assistant` — assistant response; `content` is `(TextContent \| ThinkingContent \| ToolCall)[]`
- `toolResult` — tool execution result; `content` is `(TextContent \| ImageContent)[]`
- `bashExecution` — bash command + output; `command`, `output`, `exitCode`
- `branchSummary` — branch switch summary; `summary` string
- `compactionSummary` — compaction summary; `summary` string

### Key data sources ranked by value

1. **`message` entries (`user` + `assistant`)** — full conversation transcripts; rich but noisy
2. **`compaction` entries** — pre-synthesized summaries of older context; gold
3. **`branch_summary` entries** — summaries of abandoned branches; good signal
4. **`bashExecution` entries** — concrete commands run; useful for workflow patterns
5. **`session_info` entries** — session name for topic inference

Skip `model_change`, `thinking_level_change`, `custom` (extension state), and `label` entries.

## Step 1: Survey and Compute Delta

Scan `PI_HISTORY_PATH` and compare against `.manifest.json`:

```bash
# List all session files
find ~/.pi/agent/sessions -name "*.jsonl" -type f

# Or with custom path
find "$PI_HISTORY_PATH" -name "*.jsonl" -type f
```

Build an inventory. For each session file, record:
- `path` — absolute path
- `cwd` — decoded from parent directory name (`--<path>--` → `/path`)
- `session_name` — from the latest `session_info` entry (if any)
- `modified_at` — file mtime
- `already_ingested` — presence in `.manifest.json`

Classify each file:
- **New** — not in manifest
- **Modified** — in manifest but file is newer than `ingested_at`
- **Unchanged** — already ingested and unchanged

Report a concise delta summary before deep parsing:
> "Found N Pi sessions across K projects. Delta: X new, Y modified."

## Step 2: Parse Session JSONL

For each selected session file, read it line by line. Because sessions use a tree structure, build the active branch first:

1. Parse all entries into a map by `id`
2. Find the current leaf (the entry with no children, or the last `message` entry)
3. Walk `parentId` chain from leaf to root to get the active path
4. Reverse the path so it's chronological

### Extraction rules

From the active path, extract:

- **`session` header** — `cwd`, `timestamp`, `parentSession` (if forked)
- **`session_info`** — `name` field for session title/topic inference
- **`message` entries with `role: "user"`** — extract `content` text (skip images)
- **`message` entries with `role: "assistant"`** — extract `text` content blocks; skip `thinking` blocks (noise); note `toolCall` blocks (they reveal what the agent actually did)
- **`message` entries with `role: "toolResult"`** — summarize outcomes, not full output
- **`message` entries with `role: "bashExecution"`** — extract command + exit code; recurring commands reveal build/test/deploy workflows
- **`compaction` entries** — read `summary` verbatim; it's already distilled
- **`branch_summary` entries** — read `summary` verbatim; captures abandoned approaches

### Skip / noise filters

- `thinking` content blocks — internal reasoning, not durable knowledge
- Image content blocks — skip unless the user explicitly asks for image transcription
- Raw tool outputs longer than 500 chars — summarize the outcome
- Token accounting (`usage` fields) — metadata only
- Repeated plan echoes or status updates

### Critical privacy filter

Session logs can include injected instructions, tool payloads, and sensitive text. Do not ingest verbatim.

- Remove API keys, tokens, passwords, credentials
- Redact private identifiers unless relevant and user-approved
- Summarize bash outputs that contain paths, environment variables, or secrets
- Do not quote raw `toolCall` arguments verbatim if they contain sensitive data

## Step 3: Cluster by Topic

Do not create one wiki page per session.

- Group knowledge by stable topic across many sessions
- Split mixed sessions into separate themes
- Merge recurring patterns across dates and projects
- Use the `cwd` from the session header to infer project scope
- Use `session_info.name` as a topic hint when available

## Step 4: Distill into Wiki Pages

Route extracted knowledge using existing wiki conventions:

- Project-specific architecture/process → `projects/<name>/...`
- General concepts → `concepts/`
- Recurring techniques/debug playbooks → `skills/`
- Tools/services/frameworks → `entities/`
- Cross-session patterns → `synthesis/`

For each impacted project, create/update `projects/<name>/<name>.md`.

### Writing rules

- Distill knowledge, not chronology
- Avoid "on date X we discussed..." unless date context is essential
- Add `summary:` frontmatter on each new/updated page (1–2 sentences, ≤ 200 chars)
- Add confidence and lifecycle fields to every new page:
  ```yaml
  base_confidence: 0.42
  lifecycle: draft
  lifecycle_changed: <ISO date today>
  ```
  Leave `lifecycle` unchanged on update.
- Add provenance markers:
  - `^[extracted]` when directly grounded in explicit session content (compaction/branch summaries, explicit assistant statements)
  - `^[inferred]` when synthesizing patterns across multiple sessions or inferring from tool calls
  - `^[ambiguous]` when sessions conflict or a compaction summary contradicts later turns
- Add/update `provenance:` frontmatter mix for each changed page

**Mark provenance** per the convention in `llm-wiki`:
- `compaction` and `branch_summary` entries are pre-distilled — treat as mostly `^[extracted]`
- Conversation distillation is mostly `^[inferred]` — you're synthesizing from dialogue
- Use `^[ambiguous]` when the user changed their mind across sessions or when compaction summaries disagree with later conversation turns

## Step 5: Update Manifest, Log, and Index

### Update `.manifest.json`

For each processed source file:

- `ingested_at`, `size_bytes`, `modified_at`
- `source_type`: `pi_session`
- `project`: inferred project name from decoded `cwd`
- `pages_created`, `pages_updated`

Add/update a top-level summary block:

```json
{
  "pi": {
    "source_path": "~/.pi/agent/sessions/",
    "last_ingested": "TIMESTAMP",
    "sessions_ingested": 12,
    "sessions_total": 40,
    "pages_created": 5,
    "pages_updated": 12
  }
}
```

### Update special files

Update `index.md` and `log.md`:

```
- [TIMESTAMP] PI_HISTORY_INGEST sessions=N pages_updated=X pages_created=Y mode=append|full
```

**`hot.md`** — Read `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/hot.md` (create from the template in `wiki-ingest` if missing). Update **Recent Activity** with a one-line summary — e.g. "Ingested 12 Pi sessions across 3 projects; surfaced patterns in CLI tooling and API design." Keep the last 3 operations. Update `updated` timestamp.

## Privacy and Compliance

- Distill and synthesize; avoid raw transcript dumps
- Default to redaction for anything that looks sensitive
- Ask the user before storing personal or sensitive details
- Keep references to other people minimal and purpose-bound

## Reference

See `references/pi-data-format.md` for field-level parsing notes and extraction guidance.

## QMD Refresh After Vault Writes

QMD is a search index, not the source of truth. If `$QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION` is empty or unset, skip this step. Run it only after this skill has written or rewritten vault markdown. If QMD refresh fails, do not roll back the vault changes; report the QMD status separately.

Use `$QMD_CLI` if set; otherwise use `qmd`.

```bash
${QMD_CLI:-qmd} update
```

If the output says vectors are needed or embeddings may be stale, run:

```bash
${QMD_CLI:-qmd} embed
```

Verify the collection with either:

```bash
${QMD_CLI:-qmd} ls "$QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION"
```

or, when a specific page path is known:

```bash
${QMD_CLI:-qmd} get "qmd://$QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION/<page>.md" -l 5
```

Record one of:
- `QMD refreshed: update + embed + verified`
- `QMD refreshed: update only + verified`
- `QMD skipped: QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION unset`
- `QMD skipped: qmd CLI unavailable`
- `QMD failed: <short error summary>`
