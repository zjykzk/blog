# Wiki Status — Audit & Delta

You are computing the current state of the wiki: what's been ingested, what's new since last ingest, and what the delta looks like. This helps the user decide whether to append (ingest the delta) or rebuild (archive and reprocess everything).

## Before You Start

1. Read `.env` to get `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`, `OBSIDIAN_SOURCES_DIR`, `CLAUDE_HISTORY_PATH`, `CODEX_HISTORY_PATH`
2. Read `.manifest.json` at the vault root — this is the ingest tracking ledger

## The Manifest

The manifest lives at `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/.manifest.json`. It tracks every source file that has been ingested. If it doesn't exist, this is a fresh vault with nothing ingested.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "last_updated": "2026-04-06T10:30:00Z",
  "sources": {
    "/absolute/path/to/file.md": {
      "ingested_at": "2026-04-06T10:30:00Z",
      "size_bytes": 4523,
      "modified_at": "2026-04-05T08:00:00Z",
      "source_type": "document",
      "project": null,
      "pages_created": ["concepts/transformers.md"],
      "pages_updated": ["entities/vaswani.md"]
    },
    "~/.claude/projects/-Users-name-my-app/abc123.jsonl": {
      "ingested_at": "2026-04-06T11:00:00Z",
      "size_bytes": 128000,
      "modified_at": "2026-04-06T09:00:00Z",
      "source_type": "claude_conversation",
      "project": "my-app",
      "pages_created": ["entities/my-app.md"],
      "pages_updated": ["skills/react-debugging.md"]
    }
  },
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "source_path": "~/.claude/projects/-Users-name-my-app",
      "vault_path": "projects/my-app",
      "last_ingested": "2026-04-06T11:00:00Z",
      "conversations_ingested": 5,
      "conversations_total": 8,
      "memory_files_ingested": 3
    }
  },
  "stats": {
    "total_sources_ingested": 42,
    "total_pages": 87,
    "total_projects": 6,
    "last_full_rebuild": null
  }
}
```

## Step 1: Scan Current Sources

Build an inventory of everything available to ingest right now:

### Documents (from `OBSIDIAN_SOURCES_DIR`)
```
Glob each directory in OBSIDIAN_SOURCES_DIR for all text files
Record: path, size, modification time
```

### Claude History (from `CLAUDE_HISTORY_PATH`)
```
Glob: ~/.claude/projects/*/          → project directories
Glob: ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl   → conversation files
Glob: ~/.claude/projects/*/memory/*.md → memory files
Record: path, size, modification time, parent project
```

### Codex History (from `CODEX_HISTORY_PATH`)
```
Glob: ~/.codex/session_index.jsonl            → session inventory index
Glob: ~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl    → session rollout transcripts
Glob: ~/.codex/history.jsonl                  → optional local history log
Glob: ~/.codex/archived_sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl → archived rollouts (if user wants archive coverage)
Record: path, size, modification time, inferred project from cwd when available
```

### Any other sources the user has pointed at previously
Check the manifest for source paths outside the standard directories.

## Step 2: Compute the Delta

Compare current sources against the manifest. Classify each source file:

| Status | Meaning | Action needed |
|---|---|---|
| **New** | File exists on disk, not in manifest | Needs ingesting |
| **Modified** | File in manifest, hash differs from `content_hash` | Needs re-ingesting |
| **Touched** | File in manifest, mtime newer but hash unchanged | Skip — content identical, no re-ingest needed |
| **Unchanged** | File in manifest, mtime and hash both match | Nothing to do |
| **Deleted** | In manifest, but file no longer exists on disk | Note it — wiki pages may be stale |

When a manifest entry has no `content_hash` (older entry), fall back to mtime comparison only.

For Claude history specifically, also compute:
- New projects (directories in `~/.claude/projects/` not in manifest)
- New conversations within existing projects
- Updated memory files

For Codex history specifically, also compute:
- New rollout files under `sessions/**`
- Updated `session_index.jsonl` entries (session title/freshness changes)
- Archived rollout delta only when archive coverage is requested

## Step 3: Report the Status

**Visibility tally (before rendering the report):** Grep frontmatter across all vault `.md` pages for `visibility/internal` and `visibility/pii` tag values. Count:
- `public` = pages with `visibility/public` tag **or** no `visibility/` tag at all
- `internal` = pages with `visibility/internal` tag
- `pii` = pages with `visibility/pii` tag

Include this in the Overview section as `Page visibility: N public · M internal · K pii`. Skip the line if all pages are untagged (fully public vault).

Present a clear summary:

```markdown
# Wiki Status

## Overview
- **Total wiki pages:** 87 across 6 categories
- **Page visibility:** 72 public · 11 internal · 4 pii
- **Total sources ingested:** 42
- **Projects tracked:** 6
- **Last ingest:** 2026-04-06T11:00:00Z

## Delta (what's changed since last ingest)

### New sources (never ingested): 12
| Source | Type | Size |
|---|---|---|
| ~/Documents/research/new-paper.pdf | document | 2.1 MB |
| ~/.claude/projects/-Users-.../session-xyz.jsonl | claude_conversation | 340 KB |
| ~/.codex/sessions/2026/04/12/rollout-...jsonl | codex_rollout | 220 KB |
| ... | | |

### Modified sources (need re-ingesting): 3
| Source | Last ingested | Last modified | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~/notes/architecture.md | 2026-04-01 | 2026-04-05 | 4 days newer |
| ... | | | |

### New projects (not yet in wiki): 2
- **tractorex** (3 conversations, 2 memory files)
- **papertech** (1 conversation, 0 memory files)

### Deleted sources (ingested but gone): 0

## Summary
- **Ready to ingest:** 12 new + 3 modified = 15 sources
- **Up to date:** 27 sources unchanged
- **Recommendation:** Append (delta is small relative to total)
```

## Step 4: Recommend Action

Based on the delta, recommend one of:

| Situation | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Delta is small (<20% of total) | **Append** — just ingest the new/modified sources |
| Delta is large (>50% of total) | **Rebuild** — archive and reprocess everything |
| Many deleted sources | **Lint first** — check for stale pages, then decide |
| First time / empty vault | **Full ingest** — process everything |
| User just wants to see status | **No action** — just report |

Tell the user:
- "You have X new sources and Y modified sources. I'd recommend [append/rebuild]."
- "Want me to [ingest the delta / rebuild from scratch / just look at a specific project]?"

## Insights Mode

Triggered when the user asks something like "wiki insights", "what's central in my wiki", "show me the hubs", "cross-domain bridges", "what pages are most important", or "wiki structure". This mode is *additive* — it doesn't replace the delta report, it analyzes the *shape* of the wiki itself.

Where the delta report tells the user what's pending, insights mode tells them what they've already built and where the interesting structure lives. Complements `wiki-lint` (which finds *problems*) by surfacing *interesting structure*.

### What to compute

**First, build the wikilink graph.** Glob all `.md` pages, extract every `[[wikilink]]`, and build:
- `incoming[page]` = count of other pages that link to this page
- `outgoing[page]` = count of pages this page links out to
- `tags[page]` = set of tags from frontmatter
- `category[page]` = directory prefix (concepts/, entities/, skills/, etc.)

You'll reuse this graph across all sections below.

---

1. **Anchor pages (top hubs).** Pages with the most incoming links — the load-bearing concepts.
   - Rank all pages by `incoming` count, take top 10
   - For each, note both incoming and outgoing counts: pages with high incoming *and* high outgoing are connector hubs (most valuable)
   - Pages with high incoming but zero outgoing are sink hubs — flag as cross-linker candidates

2. **Bridge pages.** Pages that connect otherwise-disconnected tag clusters — removing them would partition the graph. These are often more structurally important than raw hub count suggests.
   - For each page P, find pairs of pages (A, B) where:
     - A links to P, B is linked from P (or vice versa)
     - A and B share **no tags** with each other
     - P is the only path between A's tag cluster and B's tag cluster within 2 hops
   - Rank by how many cross-cluster pairs P bridges; show top 5
   - Label each: "`P` bridges `[tag-cluster-A]` ↔ `[tag-cluster-B]`"

3. **Tag cluster cohesion.** For each tag with ≥ 5 pages, score how tightly the pages within it are interconnected:
   - `n` = number of pages sharing this tag
   - `actual_links` = number of wikilinks between any two pages in this tag group
   - `cohesion = actual_links / (n × (n−1) / 2)` — ratio of actual links to maximum possible
   - **Fragmented clusters** (cohesion < 0.15, n ≥ 5): these pages share a topic but aren't woven together. Surface them as cross-linker targets.
   - Show top 5 tags by cohesion (strongest clusters) and bottom 5 (most fragmented)

4. **Surprising connections.** Cross-category wikilinks that are non-obvious — scored by how unexpected they are:
   - Score each wikilink that crosses category boundaries (e.g., `concepts/` → `entities/`, `skills/` → `synthesis/`):
     - **+3** if the linking page or claim is marked `^[ambiguous]` (uncertain connection, worth reviewing)
     - **+2** if the linking page is marked `^[inferred]` (synthesized, not directly stated)
     - **+2** if the categories are in different knowledge layers (e.g., `concepts` ↔ `entities` more surprising than `concepts` ↔ `concepts`)
     - **+2** if source page has ≤ 2 total links (peripheral) but target has ≥ 8 (hub) — unexpected reach from edge to center
   - Show top 5 scored connections with a plain-language reason for each

5. **Orphan-adjacent suggestions.** Pages linked from a top-10 hub but with zero outgoing links of their own. Dead-ends in high-traffic areas — prime cross-linker candidates.

6. **Rough clusters.** Group anchor pages by dominant tag. (Simple tag intersection — just for orientation.)

7. **Graph delta since last run.** Compare the current link graph to the snapshot stored in the previous `_insights.md`:
   - Read the `<!-- GRAPH_SNAPSHOT: ... -->` line at the bottom of the previous `_insights.md` (if it exists) — it contains a compact JSON edge list
   - Compute: new pages added, pages removed, new wikilinks created, wikilinks removed
   - Flag: pages that were isolated last run but now have incoming links ("newly connected: X, Y")
   - Flag: pages that lost incoming links since last run ("link target may have been renamed: A, B")
   - If no previous snapshot exists, skip this section

8. **Suggested questions.** Questions this wiki structure is uniquely positioned to answer — or that reveal gaps:
   - From `^[ambiguous]` claims: "Resolve: What is the exact relationship between `X` and `Y`?"
   - From bridge pages: "Explore: Why does `P` connect `[cluster-A]` to `[cluster-B]`?"
   - From pages with zero incoming links: "Link: `X` has no incoming links — what should reference it?"
   - From fragmented clusters (cohesion < 0.15): "Audit: Should tag `[T]` be split into more focused sub-tags?"
   - Show up to 7, prioritizing AMBIGUOUS first, then bridge nodes, then isolates

### Output

Write the result to `_insights.md` at the vault root. Overwrite freely — it's regenerable. At the very end, embed a compact graph snapshot as an HTML comment so the next run can diff against it.

```markdown
# Wiki Insights — <TIMESTAMP>

## Anchor Pages (top 10 hubs)
| Page | Incoming | Outgoing | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| [[concepts/transformer-architecture]] | 23 | 8 | connector hub |
| [[entities/andrej-karpathy]] | 17 | 0 | sink hub — cross-linker candidate |

## Bridge Pages (top 5)
| Page | Bridges | Cross-cluster pairs |
|---|---|---|
| [[concepts/exponential-growth]] | #ml ↔ #economics | 4 pairs |

## Tag Cluster Cohesion
### Most cohesive (well-linked)
- **#ml** — 12 pages, cohesion 0.41
### Most fragmented (cross-linker targets)
- **#systems** — 7 pages, cohesion 0.06 ⚠️ run cross-linker on this tag

## Surprising Connections (top 5)
- [[concepts/scaling-laws]] → [[entities/gordon-moore]] — score 5
  - Reason: cross-layer (concepts ↔ entities), marked ^[inferred]
- ...

## Orphan-Adjacent (dead-ends near hubs)
- [[concepts/foo]] — linked from 3 hubs, 0 outbound links

## Rough Clusters
- **#ml** — transformer-architecture, attention-mechanism, scaling-laws
- **#systems** — distributed-consensus, raft, paxos

## Graph Delta Since Last Run
- +3 new pages, +11 new wikilinks
- Newly connected: [[concepts/bar]], [[entities/baz]]
- Lost incoming links: [[references/old-paper]] (target may have been renamed)

## Questions Worth Asking
1. Resolve: What is the exact relationship between `scaling-laws` and `moore's-law`? (^[ambiguous] claim)
2. Explore: Why does `exponential-growth` bridge #ml and #economics?
3. Link: `references/foo.md` has no incoming links — what should reference it?
4. Audit: Should tag `#systems` be split? (cohesion 0.06, 7 pages)

<!-- GRAPH_SNAPSHOT: {"nodes":["concepts/foo","entities/bar"],"edges":[["concepts/foo","entities/bar"]]} -->
```

After writing the file, append to `log.md`:
```
- [TIMESTAMP] STATUS_INSIGHTS anchors=10 bridges=N cohesion_checked=T surprising=5 questions=7 delta="+N pages +M links"
```

### When to skip

- Vaults with fewer than 20 pages — not enough graph structure. Tell the user and skip.
- After a fresh `wiki-rebuild` — wait until at least one ingest has happened.

## Notes

- If the manifest doesn't exist, report everything as "new" and recommend a full ingest
- This skill only reads and reports — it doesn't modify anything (except writing `_insights.md` in insights mode, which is regenerable)
- The actual ingest work is done by the ingest skills (`wiki-ingest`, `claude-history-ingest`, `codex-history-ingest`, `data-ingest`)
- Those skills are responsible for updating the manifest after they finish
