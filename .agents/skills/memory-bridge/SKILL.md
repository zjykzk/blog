# Memory Bridge — Cross-Tool Knowledge Browser

You are helping the user browse and compare their Obsidian wiki knowledge filtered by which AI tool originally produced it. The wiki tracks source provenance in `.manifest.json` and page `sources:` frontmatter — this skill surfaces that metadata as a navigable view.

## Before You Start

1. **Resolve config** — follow the Config Resolution Protocol in `llm-wiki/SKILL.md` (walk up CWD for `.env` → `~/.obsidian-wiki/config` → prompt setup). This gives `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`.
2. Read `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/.manifest.json` — this is the source-of-truth for what tool produced what.
3. Read `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/index.md` for page titles and one-line descriptions.

## Commands

Parse the user's invocation to determine mode:

| Invocation | Mode |
|---|---|
| `/memory-bridge <tool>` | **Browse** — list all wiki pages sourced from `<tool>` |
| `/memory-bridge <tool> "<topic>"` | **Search** — pages from `<tool>` that mention `<topic>` |
| `/memory-bridge diff` | **Diff** — pages unique to each tool; overlap; blind spots |
| `/memory-bridge diff <tool-a> <tool-b>` | **Diff** — compare two specific tools |
| `/memory-bridge map` | **Map** — full origin matrix: every page × every tool that touched it |

Recognized tool names: `claude`, `codex`, `hermes`, `openclaw`, `copilot`, `pi`, `manual` (hand-written), `ingest` (wiki-ingest documents).

## Step 1: Build the Source Map

Read `.manifest.json`. For each source entry, extract:
- `source_type` — maps to tool name:
  - `claude_conversation`, `claude_memory`, `claude_audit_log`, `claude_desktop_session` → `claude`
  - `codex_rollout`, `codex_index`, `codex_history` → `codex`
  - `hermes_memory`, `hermes_session` → `hermes`
  - `openclaw_memory`, `openclaw_daily_note`, `openclaw_session`, `openclaw_dreams` → `openclaw`
  - `copilot_session`, `copilot_checkpoint`, `copilot_transcript`, `copilot_memory_artifact` → `copilot`
  - `pi_session` → `pi`
  - `document` → `ingest`
  - anything else → `manual`
- `pages_created` and `pages_updated` — the wiki pages that came out of this source

Build a map:

```
tool_pages = {
  "claude": set(pages created/updated by claude sources),
  "codex":  set(pages created/updated by codex sources),
  ...
}
```

A page can appear in multiple tools' sets if multiple tools contributed to it.

## Step 2: Execute the Mode

### Browse Mode

Filter `tool_pages[<tool>]` and present as a grouped list:

```
## Knowledge from <tool> (<N> pages)

### By category
- concepts/ — N pages
- entities/ — N pages
- skills/   — N pages
...

### Pages
| Page | Category | Tags | Last updated |
|------|----------|------|--------------|
| [[page-name]] | concept | tag1, tag2 | 2026-04-10 |
...
```

Read frontmatter for the listed pages (grep for `^(title|category|tags|updated):`) — do not read full page bodies unless the user asks.

### Search Mode

Within the filtered page set, run:
```
grep -l "<topic>" <pages in tool set>
```
Then grep section headers (`^##`) around matches to give context without full reads. Present results as a ranked list with the matching excerpt.

### Diff Mode

Compute:
- `only_in_a` = `tool_pages[a]` − `tool_pages[b]`
- `only_in_b` = `tool_pages[b]` − `tool_pages[a]`
- `shared` = `tool_pages[a]` ∩ `tool_pages[b]`

If no specific tools are given, compare all tools pairwise (limit to pairs with >0 overlap or unique pages to keep output concise).

Present:

```
## Memory Bridge Diff — <tool-a> vs <tool-b>

### Only in <tool-a> (<N> pages)
These concepts exist in your wiki from <tool-a> sessions but <tool-b> has never touched them.
<list with one-line descriptions from index.md>

### Only in <tool-b> (<N> pages)
<list>

### Shared (<N> pages)
Both tools have contributed to these pages.
<list — only show if ≤15; otherwise just the count>

### Notable gaps
<highlight the most interesting asymmetries — e.g. "codex has 12 pages on build tooling that claude has never seen">
```

### Map Mode

Build a matrix showing every page and which tools have touched it. Cap at 50 rows; sort by number of contributing tools descending (most cross-tool pages first — these are the richest nodes).

```
| Page | claude | codex | hermes | copilot | pi |
|------|--------|-------|--------|---------|----|
| [[react-patterns]] | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | — |
| [[rust-ownership]] | — | ✓ | — | — | ✓ |
```

## Step 3: Spawn impl-validator (if available)

After generating output, if the `impl-validator` skill is available in the current environment, spawn it as a subagent:

```
impl-validator check:
  goal: "Browse/diff wiki knowledge by source tool and surface cross-tool blind spots"
  artifacts: [the output you just generated]
  checks:
    - Did you correctly parse source_type from .manifest.json?
    - Are page counts plausible (not 0 unless vault is empty)?
    - Is the diff symmetric (a−b and b−a are disjoint)?
    - Did you avoid reading full page bodies when not needed?
```

Apply any issues it surfaces before presenting output to the user.

## Step 4: Log

Append to `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/log.md`:
```
- [TIMESTAMP] MEMORY-BRIDGE mode=<browse|search|diff|map> tool=<tool> pages_shown=N
```

## Output Conventions

- Always show page counts so the user can calibrate how much knowledge is in each tool's silo.
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` for page references (or standard Markdown links if `OBSIDIAN_LINK_FORMAT=markdown` is set).
- In diff mode, call out the most *surprising* asymmetry explicitly — that's the insight the user came for.
- If `.manifest.json` is empty or missing, say so clearly and suggest running `/wiki-history-ingest` first.
